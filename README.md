# War Ships. Evasive maneuvre edition
This is a vue.js rendition of classic Battleships or Sea Battle game with some differences:
1. You can move one of your ships one per turn, given there is space available for movement.
2. Missed shots remain on the game field as mines, that prevent ship movement.
